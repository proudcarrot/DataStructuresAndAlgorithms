Question:

You are given the source to an application which crashes when it runs. 
After running it 10 times in a debugger, you notice it doesn't crash in
the same place each time. The application is single threaded, and it only
uses the C standard library. What programming errors could be causing 
this crash? How would you test each one?

Answer:

First ask about use cases:
Who uses it?
How do they use it?
What kind of application?

From the basic info of the question:

1. A random variable is used : could make something go out of range. 
Or it is a vairable that is seemingly random because it is never 
initialized.
2. User input : the program depends on user input and some inputs could 
cause it to crash
3. Memory leak : the memory may be constantly increasing because of a 
memory leak.
