Problem: 

You have an 8x8 chess board where diagonally opposite corners have been 
cut off. If you are give 31 dominos where a single domino can cover 2 
spaces, can you cover the entire board?

Solution:

No, because you can't cover the 26 square outer bounds of the board 
fully with 13 dominos.

Another way to prove this has to do with the colors of the chess board. 
Each domino will cover a black and a white square. Taking away diagonal 
squares takes away 2 of the same color so the dominos cannot cover the squares exactly.
