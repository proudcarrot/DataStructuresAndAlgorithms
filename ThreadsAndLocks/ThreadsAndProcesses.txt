What is the difference between threads and processes?

My Answer:

Threads have shared memory
Processes have their own buckets of memory carved out
	In parallel computing could have shared resources

Answer:

Process is an instance of a program in execution
Is an independent entity to which system resources (CPU time and memory) are allocated
Processes cannot access each others memory
To communicate between processes, you need pipes, files, sockets or other such things

Threads exist within processes. They share the process' resources. They have their own registers and stack but they share the heap, this means that changes by one thread will be seen by other threads. 
A thread is a particular execution path of a process.
