Question:

Compare and contrast a hash table and an STL map. How is a hash table 
implemented? If the number of inputs is small, which data structure 
options can be used instead of a hash table?

Answer:

Hash tables are often implemented as an array of lists. Their lookup up 
time is O(n) in the worst case, O(1) amortized if there are few 
collisions. This means that the hashing function must be very good. 
Insertion for a hash table assuming no collisions is O(1).

STL Map is implemented as a binary search tree. O(logn) lookup and insertion. 

These are both uses for uniqueness with key/value pairs. If the number of inputs is small, a map is a good option instead of a hash table.
